# Data Mining Clustering
Computer Assignment #3, Data Mining Course, University of Tehran

In 2014, a team of researchers collected data on diabetes patients from dozens of hospitals and clinics in the United States in an article entitled [Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates: Analysis of 70,000 Clinical Database Patient Records](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/). Some of this information has been made available to the public (Anonymously), which includes one hundred thousand items with fifty features[.](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130+us+hospitals+for+years+1999+2008)

In this project, we use **Clustering** algorithms such as `K-Means` and `DBSCAN` to cluster the given data.
